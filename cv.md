## Code Example
### KATA from CODEWARS: 
*After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you. You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers. Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.
Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).*
```
function rentalCarCost(d) {
  if (d >= 7) {
    return (d * 40) - 50;
  } else if (d >= 3) {
    return (d * 40) - 20;
  } else {
    return d * 40;
  }
}
